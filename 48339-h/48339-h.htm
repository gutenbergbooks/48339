<h2>STATING THE CASE</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/i_005.jpg" alt="Mr. Punch, as judge" width="194" height="300" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Punch has done his
share towards bringing
about various law reforms.
We find him hammering
away continually for many
years at the Law’s delays, its
costliness, its inconsistencies,
and the evils he has satirised,
the inconveniences he has
laughed at have largely been
remedied. He makes fun of
the jesting judge and the
bullying barrister, while he
is genially amusing at the
expense of the timid and
blundering witness, and the
youthful vanity or elderly pomposity of members of
the bench and bar. He is rightly bitter now and then
when he touches on the comparatively light sentences
inflicted on audacious, but wealthy, swindlers, and
the comparatively heavy penalties exacted from lesser,
poorer, and more ignorant burglars and pickpockets;
but in the main he devotes himself to the lighter
side of law and justice and the professions that are
concerned in its administration.</p>

<p>Here and there you come across echoes of famous
law suits&mdash;of the Tichborne trial, the Parnell Commission;
here and there you have reminders of
Bradlaugh’s fight to get into Parliament without
taking the oath; of the days when London was
agitated by the Fenian scare and valorous householders
were sworn in as special constables, and
again when everybody passing into the law courts
had to open his bag that the policeman on duty
might be assured that he was not carrying a bomb
inside it.</p>

<p>The reading matter is particularly apt and good;
not a little of it was written by barristers in the
intervals of waiting for briefs, and the writers were
thus intimately acquainted with the grievances they
ventilated, and were often suffering the hardships of
the briefless themselves when they sat down to make
fun of them.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH IN WIG AND GOWN</h2>

<h3>OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENCE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Novice.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Don’t, unless you want penal
servitude for life. (<i>b</i>) Any respectable burglar.
(<i>c</i>) We do not answer questions on chiropody
in this column.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hard Up.</span>&mdash;<i>Brougham on Conveyances</i> will
explain whether your contract to purchase
the motor-car is binding or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer.</span>&mdash;It is either an “escrow” or a scarecrow;
impossible to state definitely without
further information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. and S.</span>&mdash;There is no reduction (of the fine)
in taking a quantity&mdash;generally the reverse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Traveller.</span>&mdash;By travelling in the manner you
describe, viz., under the seat, you render yourself
liable to “stoppage <i>in transitu</i>,” and to completing
the rest of your journey on foot “<i>in
custodia legis</i>.” The authorities on this point are
very clear. See <i>Constable’s Reports</i>, P.C. X. Y. Z.,
Vol. XIV., pages 72-85.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Justice.</span>&mdash;If the defendant lost, you, being plaintiff
would win, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Consult a
solicitor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Student.</span>&mdash;Can only spare space for half your
questions. “Aggravated assault” explains itself,
an assault which aggravates or annoys you.
“Damage fesant,” a badly shot pheasant.
“Simple larceny,” taking an empty purse out
of a pocket in which a sovereign is lying loose.
“Misdemeanour” is of course the demeanour of
an unmarried woman, or in plainer language, the
airs she gives herself.</p>

<h3>THE MODERN CLUTCHES OF THE LAW</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragment from a Criminal Romance</i>)</p>

<p>The burglar had so far been successful. He
had broken open the safe and transferred its contents
to his pocket without disturbing the household.
He had come down the creaking stairs with
less than the customary noise. He was in sight of
the street door, which, once opened, passed, and
closed, would lead to freedom.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant prospect.</p>

<p>“It will delight my wife and little ones,” he
murmured. “With the proceeds of this night’s
work I shall be able to take them a trip to the
Continent.”</p>

<p>Then he walked forward and opened the street
door. In a moment he was seized by mechanical
hands, and found himself manacled.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” he cried; “I had forgotten that
recently patented novelty&mdash;the automatic policeman!”</p>

<h3>DIVORCE MADE EASY</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>St. James’s Gazette</i>, dealing with
the subject of the Divorce Laws, calmly proposes
that in any revision of the code, which he strongly
advocates, “women should be placed on the same
footing with men.” Such a pestilent heresy of
course provoked correspondence, and, as I have
made a careful study of the subject, I beg to submit
to you, sir, a few reasonable grounds for
divorce, which this reformer will, I hope, include in
his precious revised code.</p>

<p>A man should be allowed to obtain a divorce
from his wife on all or any of the following
grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. If he sees anyone he likes better than his
wife.</p>

<p>2. If his mother-in-law comes too often.</p>

<p>3. If his wife’s brother borrows money of him.</p>

<p>4. If she objects to his going to Paris without
her.</p>

<p>5. If, knowing that he prefers the tops of the
muffins at breakfast, she eats any of them.</p>

<p>6. If she hears him come in at four in the
morning, when he has considerately taken off his
boots to do so quietly.</p>

<p>7. If she refers to it.</p>

<p>8. If she ever says, “My dear, I think we’ve
heard that story before.”</p>

<p>9. If she does not laugh consumedly whenever
he tells a comic story.</p>

<p>10. If she objects to smoking.</p>

<p>11. If she is not civil to <i>all</i> his male friends.</p>

<p>12. And female ones.</p>

<p>There, sir, you have a dozen suggestions which
I would commend to the attention of this law-reformer.
You will observe I have not included
any <i>trivial</i> reasons for divorce, and the procedure,
as the <i>St. James’s Gazette</i> says, “should be as
expeditious and inexpensive as possible.”</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>A junior who will wear his gown straight, and
not pretend that intense preoccupation over dummy

shoulder.</p>

<p>A judge who can resist the temptation to utter
feeble witticisms, and to fall asleep.</p>

<p>A witness who answers questions, and incidentally
tells the truth.</p>

<p>A jury who do not look extremely silly, and
ridiculously self-conscious, when directly addressed
or appealed to by counsel; or one that really
understands that the judge’s politeness is only
another and subtle form of self-glorification.</p>

<p>A K.C. who is not “eminent,” who does not
behave “nobly,” and who can avoid the formula
“I suggest to you,” in cross-examination; or one
that does not thunder from a lofty and inaccessible
moral altitude so soon as a nervous witness blunders
or contradicts himself.</p>

<p>An usher who does not try to induce the general
public, especially the female portion thereof, to
mistake him for the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>A solicitor who does not strive to appear <i>coram
populo</i> on terms of quite unnecessarily familiar
intercourse with his leading counsel.</p>

<p>An articled clerk who does not dress beyond
his thirty shillings a-week, and think that the
whole court is lost in speculation as to the identity
of that distinguished-looking young man.</p>

<p>An associate who does not go into ecstasies of
merriment over every joke or <i>obiter dictum</i> from the
Bench.</p>

<p>Anybody who does not give loud expression to
the opinion, at the nearest bar when the court
rises, that he could have managed the case for
either or both sides infinitely better than the counsel
engaged.</p>

<p>A court-house whose atmosphere is pleasant and
invigorating after the court has sat for fifteen
minutes.</p>

remarks in print, will think that the cap can, by
any <i>scintilla</i> of possibility, fit himself.)</p>

<h3>WHAT A BARRISTER MAY DO; AND WHAT HE MAY NOT DO</h3>

<p>There seems to be at present a very considerable
difference of opinion among the gentlemen
of the Bar as to what may or may not be
done by a barrister. We had some idea of
publishing a small hand-book of <i>etiquette</i> for the
exclusive use of the gentlemen of the long robe;
but as what is etiquette to-day may not be etiquette
to-morrow, we feared the work would not possess
the permanent utility which alone would recompense
us for the labour of writing it. We have,
however, drawn up a few general rules founded on
our own observation as to what a barrister may do,
and what he may not do, consistently with his
professional dignity:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. A barrister may be employed in inducing
Members of Parliament to vote in favour of railway
bills; <i>but</i> he may not report for a newspaper.</p>

<p>2nd. A barrister may practise the “artful dodge”
for the purpose of defeating the ends of justice;
<i>but</i> he must not enter an assize town in an
omnibus.</p>

<p>3rd. A barrister may tout for a small judgeship;
<i>but</i> he will be very properly disbarred if he advertises
his readiness to plead the cause of clients.</p>

<p>4th. A barrister may libel a rival candidate for
an office in a “private and confidential” circular;
<i>but</i> he must not degrade himself by asking an
attorney to dine with him on the circuit.</p>

<p>5th. A barrister may take a fee when he knows
he cannot attend to the cause; <i>but</i> he may not
return the money, for his doing so would be very
unprofessional.</p>

<p>6th, and lastly. A barrister may be a very honourable
man; <i>but</i> many things which professional
<i>etiquette</i> allows him to do, would be thought disgraceful
and dishonest among ordinary people.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">A Delicate Distinction.</span>&mdash;<i>Cross-examining
Counsel (to fair witness).</i> And is your name

to give extended publicity to the important public
directions to the unhappy suitors, who may have
been wandering in the Court so many years. The
information is contained in the following short

<h3>WHAT IT MAY COME TO!</h3>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Central Criminal Court. The usual
company assembled, and the place wearing its
customary aspect. “Standing room only”
everywhere, except in the jury box, which is
empty. Prisoner at the bar.</i></p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> This is most annoying! Owing to the
refusal of the jury to serve, the time of the Bar,
the Bench, and I may even add, the prisoner, is
wasted! I really don’t know what to do! Mr.
Twentybob, I think you appear for the accused?</p>

<p><i>Counsel for the Defence.</i> Yes, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Judge (with some hesitation).</i> Well, I do not for
a moment presume to dictate to you, but it certainly
would get us out of a serious difficulty if
your client pleaded guilty. I suppose you have
carefully considered his case, and think it advisable
that he should not withdraw his plea?</p>

<p><i>Counsel for the Defence.</i> No, my lord, I certainly
cannot advise him to throw up his defence. It is a
serious&mdash;a deeply serious&mdash;matter for him. I do
not anticipate any difficulty in establishing his
innocence before an intelligent jury.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> But we can’t get a jury&mdash;intelligent or
otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Counsel for the Defence.</i> If no evidence is
offered, my client should be discharged.</p>

<p><i>Counsel for the Prosecution.</i> I beg pardon, but
I must set my friend right. Evidence <i>is</i> offered in
support of the charge, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Yes; but there is no properly constituted
body to receive and decide upon its credibility.
I am glad that the grand jury (to whom
I had the privilege of addressing a few observations
upon our unfortunate position) have ignored a
larger number of bills than usual; still, the present
case is before the court, and I must dispose of it.
Can you assist us in any way, Mr. Perplebagge?</p>

<p><i>Counsel for the Prosecution (smiling).</i> I am
afraid not, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Well, I suppose I have no alternative
but to order the prisoner to be taken back to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> To the place I was in last night?
No thankee!&mdash;not me! Look here, gemmen all,
we knows one another, don’t we? Well, just to
oblige you&mdash;as Dartmoor ain’t ’arf bad in the
summer, and as in course I <i>did</i> do it&mdash;I plead
guilty!</p>

<h3>LEGAL MAXIMS</h3>

<p class="hanging">(<i>Suggestions for alteration and adaptation to Modern
Manners and Customs, after the Jackson decision
by the Court of Appeal.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Common Law.</i>&mdash;“The tradition of ages shall
prevail,” save when it runs counter to the opinions
of a leader-writer of a daily-paper.</p>

<p><i>Equity.</i>&mdash;(1.) “No right shall be without a
remedy,” save when it is sentimentally suggested
that somebody’s right may be somebody else’s
wrong.</p>

<p>(2.) “Equity follows the law,” at such a distance
that it never comes up with it.</p>

<p>(3.) “Equity is equality,” save when a man’s
wife is literally his better half.</p>

<p>(4.) “Where there is equal equity the law must
prevail,” in any view it pleases to take at the
instance of the Lord Chancellor for the time being.</p>

<p>(5.) “Where the equities are equal the law
prevails,” in any course it likes to pursue.</p>

<p>(6.) “Equity looks upon that as done which is
agreed to be done,” especially when, after obtaining
legal relief, the suitor ultimately finds himself
sold.</p>

<p><i>Contracts.</i>&mdash;(1.) “All contracts are construed
according to the intentions of the parties,” save
where one of them subsequently changes his mind.</p>

<p>(2.) “The construction should be liberal” enough
to suit the fancy of the Judge who enforces it.</p>

<p>(3.) “It should be favourable” to a long and
angry correspondence in all the principal newspapers.</p>

<p>(4.) “The contract should in general be construed
according to the law of the country where
made,” but certainly not in particular.</p>

<p>(5.) “That testimony cannot be given to vary,
but may to explain a written contract,” save when
someone suggests that this practice shall be
reversed.</p>

<p>(6.) “He who employs an agent does it himself,”
unless it is considered advisable to take an
opposite view of the matter.</p>

<p><i>Parent and Child.</i>&mdash;“A father shall have the
custody of his children,” except when they get
beyond his control and defy his authority.</p>

<p><i>Landlord and Tenant.</i>&mdash;“A landlord has a right
to receive his rent,” if the tenant does not spend
the money on something else.</p>

<p><i>Husband and Wife.</i>&mdash;“A man has a right to the
society of his wife,” when she does not prefer to
give her company elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Birthright of an Englishman.</i> (<i>Popular traditionally,
but strictly speaking supplementary.</i>)&mdash;“An
Englishman’s house is his castle,” but only the
<i>pied à terre</i> of the lawfully wedded sharer of his
income.</p>

<h3>CRIMINALS’ ASSURANCE SOCIETY</h3>

<p>It being considered in accordance with the spirit
of the age, the march of intellect, and the principles
of progress, that those persons
who are unfortunate
enough to come under the
unfavourable notice of tribunals
established in unenlightened
times, should be
enabled to avail themselves
of systematic arrangements
for defeating the coarse and
selfish tyranny of the many,
an association is in course
of formation with the following
objects:&mdash;</p>

<p>To defend, in the best
and most costly manner, all
persons who, being assured
in the projected society, shall be afflicted by
prosecutions.</p>

<p>To supply, with the aid of practised writers,
sensation articles to such newspapers as can be
induced to accept them, such articles being framed
in favour of convicted persons, and designed to
produce a popular impression in their favour, by
attacking the witnesses against them, vilifying
hostile counsel, and ridiculing jurymen.</p>

<p>To procure other articles, in a graver tone, in
which every mistake previously made by what is
called justice shall be held up as an awful warning,
and in which intimidation shall be freely directed
against judges, Home Secretaries, and all who are
charged with carrying the laws into effect.</p>

<p>To collect, after verdicts have been given, every
kind of gossip, rumour, or invention that can discredit
the case for the prosecution, and to circulate such
things as largely as possible by means of the
Press.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/i_114.jpg" alt="Sailor trying to wind a grandfather clock" width="217" height="350" />
<p>A salt and battery</p>
</div>

<p>To get up petitions in favour of the convicted
persons, some of such petitions to be framed so as
to command the approbation of those who object
to the special form of punishment that may have
been awarded, and without reference to the innocence
or guilt of the convicted parties.</p>

<p>It is believed, and experience warrants the belief,
that by the irregular use of these and similar means
a criminal trial will speedily be deprived of its
antiquated solemnity and terror, and that the odds
in favour of the ultimate escape of the assured will
be very heavy indeed.</p>

<p>To the objection of the prejudiced, that such a
system is unconstitutional, and tends to the subversion
of the rules by which society is now protected,
the promoters
would reply, that the
march of intellect, the
spirit of the age, and the
principles of progress,
render such a cavil futile
in the extremest degree.</p>

<p>A more detailed prospectus
will speedily be
issued with assurance
tables prepared for the
information of those who,
with a wise forethought,
look forward to their probably coming into collision
with conventional arrangements, but who,
owing to the uncertainties of life, may not be
aware whether such collision will be occasioned
by murder, manslaughter, burglary, highway
robbery, garrotting, embezzlement, theft, or any
other departure from ordinary rules. The rates
will be carefully calculated, and brought within
the means of all.</p>

<h3>LAW AND POLICE</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A report of the future</i>)</p>

<p>The report that the Flashaway divorce suit is
postponed is unfounded. It will commence on
Tuesday as advertised. There are still a few
gallery seats to be obtained at five guineas each.</p>

<p>At Bow Street yesterday, John Jones, a costermonger,
was summoned for having obstructed the
crowd waiting outside the pit of the Divorce Court.
Lady Hightone having given evidence in support of
the charge, the defendant explained that he was
merely trying to get his barrow through the crowd
on his way from Covent Garden.</p>

<p>The magistrate said that the pleasure-seeking
public must be protected, and fined him five pounds
and costs.</p>

<p>At the same court, the Earl of Blankley was
charged with having driven a motor car to the
public danger, and further with having run down
a boy with fatal result.</p>

<p>His lordship explained that he was co-respondent
in a divorce suit, and was on his way to the
Law Courts when the accident occurred. The
speed may have been a little excessive.</p>

<p>The magistrate said, that bearing in mind the
public character of the business on which the defendant
was engaged, he would discharge him on
payment of half-a-crown and the funeral expenses.</p>

<p>The fine was at once paid.</p>

<h3>THE WAY THEY HAVE AT THE BAR</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragment from a romance not entirely imaginary</i>)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>A corridor in the Royal Courts. Eminent
counsel in conversation with estimable solicitor
and respected client.</i></p>

<p><i>Client.</i> I am rather sorry, sir, that you could not
conduct my case in person.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> So am I. I took a deal of trouble in
preparing the argument I proposed to advance,
and it was a great disappointment to me that I
was unable to deliver it in person.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> But your junior, sir, represented you to
perfection.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> I am rejoiced to hear it. I give every
credit to my young and learned friend, and am
pleased to think that when we met in consultation
I was able to choose the right line of policy.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Besides, if you were not with us, your
retainer prevented you from being against us. And
that was a distinct advantage.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> You are most flattering, and too kind.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Not at all; and I am sure my client
agrees with me?</p>

<p><i>Client.</i> Well, of course I would rather have had
the assistance of silk, although your junior no
doubt did his best.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> I am sure he did. And now, gentlemen,
is there anything further I can do for you?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Thank you very much&mdash;I think not.
You got up your case, consulted with your junior
and if you were prevented from putting in an
appearance in the Court itself, were there in spirit.
Besides, I repeat it was a good thing for us that
you did not join the Bar of the other side. Thank
you very much indeed, sir. Good day.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> Good day. (<i>He prepares to walk off,
when, noticing a movement of the solicitor, he
stops.</i>) You are sure I can do nothing more for
you?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Oh, it’s scarcely worth mentioning.
But perhaps you would not mind returning your
fee.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> With the greatest pleasure! (<i>Hands over
a bag of gold and exit.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Client.</i> Well, really, that seems to me very
generous! Isn’t it rather unusual?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Unusual! Oh dear no! Why, it’s the
practice of the whole profession!</p>

<h3>LAW OF DIVORCE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;A “Barrister” who lately wrote to the
<i>Times</i>, in order to draw public attention to the
existing anomalies in the Law of Divorce, omitted
all mention of one of its most glaring absurdities.
Allow me to state a case in point. Mr. A. runs
away with Mrs. B., very good, I mean, of course
very bad; well, Mrs. A. sues for a divorce  from
Mr. A., and obtains an order for alimony <i>pendente
lite</i>. Mr. A. objects to pay this amount for the
support of his wife, whereupon the Judge “orders
an attachment to issue.” Now, sir, if it be, as it
certainly is, in the power of the Judge Ordinary to
order Mr. A.’s attachment to <i>Issue</i>, why should he
not be able judicially to order Mr. A.’s attachment
to <i>Wife</i>? I remain, sir, yours thoughtfully.</p>

<h3>LESSONS IN JUSTICE</h3>

<p class="center">(IN TWO TONGUES)</p>

<p class="center"><i>The French Method, reported in a Paris Paper.
Close of the Thirteenth Day.</i></p>

<p>The prisoner was admitted. He was self-possessed,
grand, mysterious. He glanced round
him with a air of disdain, and jeeringly bowed to
the president, who regarded him with hatred.
Then the president put questions to him.</p>

<p><i>The President.</i> You are a thief, a scoundrel, an
assassin! You know you committed the crime of
which you are accused. You are a villain!</p>

<p><i>The Prisoner.</i> And you&mdash;polite.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>General assent.</i></p>

<p><i>The President (with indignation).</i> I will not
have you say so! I tell you that I know you
entered the room with the pistol. I know that
you fired at the deceased. You know you did!
Tell me, did you not kill the deceased?</p>

<p><i>The Prisoner.</i> Why should I tell you? Is not
your head of wood, M’sieur le Président.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>General laughter.</i></p>

<p><i>The President (with anger).</i> You shall pay
dearly for this! You have insulted me&mdash;you have
insulted the son of my mother&mdash;and insulting her
son, you have also insulted my mother!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>A deep murmur.</i></p>

<p><i>The Prisoner (shuddering).</i> Oh, no! I deny
it! I am not so base!</p>

<p><i>The President.</i> But I tell you you are! I tell
you that there is no more wicked man in the world
than yourself! You are a poltroon!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Murmurs.</i></p>

<p><i>The Prisoner.</i> And you call the father of my
innocent child a poltroon? It is an outrage!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>General assent.</i></p>

<p><i>The President.</i> Your appeal to your innocent
babe will avail you nothing. Your innocent babe
would be better without such a father! (<i>General
Shuddering.</i>) Yes, I mean what I say&mdash;you are a
craven!</p>

<p><i>The Prisoner.</i> This is too much! I am no
craven! I love my country as a mother loves her
son.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>General assent.</i></p>

<p><i>M. le Président.</i> You insult France when you
call yourself her son! You insult the Republic.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Loud murmurs.</i></p>

<p><i>The Prisoner.</i> It is not for you to judge! I
know you, M’sieur le Président. Forty years ago
you were in the service of the King!</p>

<p><i>M. le Président (with a cry).</i> You shall be
gagged if you utter such calumnies! You are a
knave, a vagabond, a cut-throat! And now it is
for the jury to decide. Have you anything to say
in your defence?</p>

<p><i>The Prisoner (to the Jury).</i> I have nothing to
say, save that I brand this man as a traitor! As
for me I ask for liberty in the name of my infant&mdash;in
the name of my child! I confess I am no
saint, and if I <i>have</i> murdered, why in the name of
my innocent babe I beg of you to stretch out your
hands to me and save me from the scaffold. I
wish to return to the world to watch by the side of
a cradle!</p>

<p>The jury, who were deeply affected, then retired,
and, after two hours’ absence, returned a verdict of
Guilty.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The English Method, reported in a London Paper.
End of the First Day.</i></p>

<p>The prisoner, who was ably represented by
counsel, appeared to be deeply sensible of his
position. He kept his eyes on the jury during the
brief summing up.</p>

<p>His Lordship said that he trusted the jury would
give the benefit of any doubt they might feel in
the prisoner’s favour. In so serious a case they
must not convict unless they were convinced of
his guilt. The facts had been carefully laid before
them, and he would not say a word to bias them
one way or the other. He entreated them to
remember that the life of a fellow creature was at
stake, and to let that recollection make them
desirous to record only what was proper and just.
The jury then retired, and, after five minutes’
absence, returned a verdict of Guilty.</p>

<p><i>The Duke (finishing a long business talk).</i> And
I suppose we had better be represented by Mr.
Silvertongue, the Queen’s Counsel?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts (hesitating).</i> Certainly, your Grace,
if it is your express wish.</p>

<p><i>The Duke (surprised).</i> Why, Mr. Kosts, you
surely know of no better representative?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts (hurriedly).</i> Oh no, your Grace.
Mr. Silvertongue is a most eloquent advocate, and
has the law at his fingers’ ends; but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> Well? Surely we may entrust
ourselves in his hands with perfect confidence?
Do you not think so?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts.</i> Oh, certainly, your Grace, certainly.
(<i>Hesitating.</i>) But matters have changed a little
lately. There has been an alteration in the law.</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts.</i> Yes, your Grace. The fact is,
that the two branches of the legal profession have
been amalgamated.</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> I don’t quite understand.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts.</i> Why, your Grace, there is now no
real distinction between solicitors and barristers,
except in name. So I thought, your Grace, that
as I could do the work as well, that perhaps I
might replace Mr. Silvertongue, and&mdash;&mdash; You see,
it is simply a matter of business.</p>

<p><i>The Duke (interrupting).</i> Certainly, certainly,
Mr. Kosts. No doubt you could represent me
admirably. But you see I am afraid Mr. Silvertongue
might be a little offended. You know he
is a personal friend of mine, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts (promptly, with a bow).</i> I trust your
Grace will not give the matter another thought&mdash;Mr.
Silvertongue shall be instructed. (<i>Preparing
to go.</i>) Of course, your Grace’s young relative, the
Honourable Charles Needy, will act as junior?</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> Certainly, Mr. Kosts. Give Charley
as much of my work as possible. My wife’s
cousin, I am afraid, is not overburdened with
briefs.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts.</i> I am afraid not, your Grace. And
yet Mr. Needy is a sharp and clever young
gentleman. Good day, your Grace!</p>

<p><i>The Duke (after a moment’s thought, suddenly).</i>
One moment, Mr. Kosts. Did I understand you
to say that the two branches of the legal profession
were amalgamated?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts.</i> To all intents and purposes, your
Grace. You see we can now do all the work of
the Bar.</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> And I suppose barristers can act as
solicitors&mdash;I mean, undertake the same kind of
business?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts (laughing).</i> There is nothing to
prevent them, your Grace, save their incapacity.</p>

<p><i>The Duke (with dignity).</i> No relative of the
Duchess, Mr. Kosts, can be incapable!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts (puzzled).</i> I beg your Grace’s pardon.
I do not quite understand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> Then I will explain. You tell me
that barristers can now act as solicitors. Well,
you know the old adage, that “blood is thicker
than water.” It is, Mr. Kosts; it is. You will
pardon me, I am sure, if I suggest that the connection
of your firm with my family has not been
unlucrative.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts.</i> On the contrary, your Grace! I
may fairly say that the connection is worth many
hundreds a-year to us. We cannot be sufficiently
grateful.</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> Pray desist, Mr. Kosts. The matter
is one of pure business. It really is not at all a
question of gratitude. Well, as I understand you
to say that Mr. Needy is quite qualified to undertake
solicitor’s work&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts (blankly).</i> Theoretically, your Grace;
theoretically.</p>

<p><i>The Duke (haughtily).</i> Any relative of the
Duchess can reduce theory to practice.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Kosts (bowing).</i> No doubt, your Grace; no
doubt.</p>

<p><i>The Duke.</i> Well, as I now find that Charley
can do the work I have hitherto given to you,
Mr. Kosts, I feel that some alteration must be
made. Charley is poor, and my relative. So I
am sure you will not be offended when for the
future I give him the whole of the legal work I
used to give to you. You see, after all (as you
explained to me just now) it is purely a matter of
business!</p>

<h3>MY FIRST CLIENT</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>By A. Briefless, Junior</i>)</p>

<p>“Here is something for you, sir,” said a sharp-looking
youth, suddenly thrusting into my hand a
document.</p>

<p>I quietly put the paper into my pocket without
comment (I had no wish to bandy words with the
process-server), and reflected that some half-forgotten
tailor, or too-long-neglected hatter, was a
person of no real delicacy of feeling.</p>

<p>“And will you see to the matter at once?” continued
the sharp-looking youth, “as they can’t
wait.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I replied, with a dignity which I
intended should suggest that I had a perfectly
fabulous account at Coutts’s. My account at the
celebrated banking firm referred to <i>is</i> perfectly
fabulous.</p>

<p>“All right, sir. I suppose we shall see you in
the morning.”</p>

<p>The youth disappeared, and I journeyed home.
As I walked along the Thames Embankment I
pondered over the alterations made in our law by
the Judicature Acts.</p>

<p>“When I was a younger man,” I murmured to
myself, “a copy of a writ, when considered entirely
without prejudice, was rather a handsome instrument
than otherwise. The direct message from
the Sovereign, for instance, used to be very far
from ungratifying, although perhaps it would have
been better had the greeting been joined to a
matter a little less embarrassing, say, than an
unsatisfied claim for the value of certain shirts.
But nowadays the neat crisp document of the olden
time seems to be abandoned for a far more bulky
paper&mdash;for the packet I have in my pocket!”</p>

<p>However, I threw off my cares, and thought no
more of the affair until the next morning, when,
putting on my overcoat, I discovered, to my
intense astonishment, to my overwhelming joy,
that what I had believed to be a writ was actually
a brief. I had to sit down on the hall-chair for
five minutes to compose myself. My emotion was
perfectly painful&mdash;it was my first, my maiden
brief! The news spread like wildfire through
the household, and the distant strains of “Rule,
Britannia!” were heard coming from the nursery.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="Man in pub" width="350" height="233" />
</div>

<p>There was but one thing to be done, and I did
it. I hurriedly collected all the law-books I possess
(Shearwood’s “Abridgment of Real Property,” an
odd volume of Stephen’s “Commentaries,” and an
early edition of “The Comic Blackstone”), jumped
into a hansom, and rattled down to Pump-Handle
Court. Arrived there, I handed my brief to my
clerk (the sharp-looking youth who had given me
the paper turned out to be my clerk), and instructed
him to put it in a prominent position in his
own room, so that my client, when he arrived,
might see it, and conclude that I had so many
matters just then in hand that I had not had as
yet time to look into his case, which was waiting
its turn for consideration with numerous others.
I was ashamed to give these instructions, but
reflected that it was important, having regard to
my professional prospects, that my expected visitor
should be kept as long as possible in ignorance of
the fact that he was my solitary employer.</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” said my clerk, with a facial
gesture which I regret to say savoured of a wink.
“He will be here by eleven.”</p>

<p>I now entered my own room. It was rather in
disorder. I share my chambers with an intimate
friend, and as I am very often away, he sometimes
uses my <i>sanctum</i> (entirely with my consent) as a
receptacle for empty packing-cases, old cigar-boxes,
superfluous window-curtains, and worn-out
boots. With the assistance of my clerk, who
followed me in, I soon set things to rights, putting
on the month-indicator from October to March,
filling the inkstand with copying fluid, and removing
somebody’s pot-hat from the brows of my bust
of the late Lord Chancellor Brougham.</p>

<p>“There, sir, I think that will do now,” said my
clerk, with a look of satisfaction, and he left me
seated at my desk turning over some dusty brief
paper which I had found knocking about in one of
the drawers.</p>

<p>My room is a semi-subterranean apartment in a
circular tower. I have two small casements looking
out upon some gardens, but as I occupy the
basement, I can only see the ankles of the passers-by,
and am myself free from observation save when
some more than usually unruly urchin brings his
head level with mine, and makes faces at me
through the window.</p>

<p>I repeat I was turning over the dusty brief-paper,
and toying with Mr. Shearwood’s very
excellent “Abridgment,” when the door was thrown
open and my clerk announced, “Someone to see
you, sir.”</p>

<p>“You will pardon me,” I said, without looking
up, consulting in the meantime the hand-book
before me with knitted brows, “but I am engaged
for a few moments. I will attend to you directly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, sir,” replied the new-comer, in the
most deferential tone possible; and he took a seat.</p>

<p>I jotted down the incidents of Borough English,
frowned as if engaged in deep thought, and then
smilingly turned to my visitor, and asked him how
I could be of service to him.</p>

<p>“I want you to look into this case, sir,” he began,
with a timidity that was as unexpected as it was
gratifying&mdash;his nervousness gave me confidence.</p>

<p>“By all means,” I responded heartily, dipping a
pen into the ink, and putting a fresh sheet of brief-paper
over the page I had already used for the
incidents of Borough English and a freehand
sketch of a British Grenadier, “I shall be glad to
hear all about it.”</p>

<p>“I must apologise for intruding upon you, knowing
how busy you are, but I thought you would be
interested in what I have to place before you.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not apologise,” I hastened to say; and
then added, with a little laugh, “I certainly have
taken you out of your turn, but then this is our
first transaction. I hope it will not be the last.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too,” replied my client, fervently.
“If you will allow me, I will often place things like
this before you. I should have come to you earlier
only so many gentlemen object to seeing me.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” I replied, a little surprised. “I
suppose some men don’t care to jeopardise their
professional reputation by failure. And now, with
your permission, I will look into your case.”</p>

<p>“It is here, sir,” he answered, opening a rather
large portfolio. “You will notice that these are
very beautiful engravings.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I returned, making a note on the
paper before me; “as you say, most beautiful. No
doubt of very considerable value.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you like them, sir. They are forced
to be got rid of at an enormous sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” I ejaculated, continuing my notes.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They are being sold at something
less than cost-price.”</p>

<p>“Really!” And again I jotted down the particulars.
Then I said, to show that I comprehended
the affair at a glance, “I suppose there has been a
dispute about the copyright?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, that’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Ah, to be sure&mdash;then there has been a breach of
contract?” But finding that this also was not the
case, I said, with hearty <i>bonhomie</i>, “Well, my dear
sir, as I have made two bad guesses, perhaps you
had better tell me what I can do for you.”</p>

<p>My client coughed deferentially, and then produced
a paper.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but would you mind
signing this?”</p>

<p>I read the document&mdash;it ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To Messrs. Scamp and Vamp.&mdash;<i>I hereby agree
to purchase one copy of your ‘Pillars of the Law
from the Earliest Ages,’ profusely illustrated, in one
hundred and fifty-seven monthly parts, at seven
shillings and sixpence a part. I further agree to pay
for this work annually, at the rate of twelve parts in
advance.</i>”</p>

<p>There was a solemn and awful pause. Then I
drew myself up to my full height, and in a voice of
thunder <i>ordered him out</i>! I know not <i>how</i> he disappeared&mdash;in
a moment he had vanished, portfolio
and all!</p>

<p>Rather fatigued after my late exertions, I called
to my clerk, and with weary haughtiness desired
him to bring me my brief, as I wished to “glance
through the papers.”</p>

<p>“Your brief, sir?” he returned. “Oh, I should
have told you, sir, that, while you were talking to
the man with the engravings, they called to see
you. They said they were in a hurry, and as you
were engaged, they would take it to some one
else.”</p>

<p>“Take it to some one else!” My maiden brief!</p>

<p>At this point I must pause&mdash;for the moment, I
can write no more!</p>
